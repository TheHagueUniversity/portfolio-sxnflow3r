              <p>Hey! I’m Jamie, an aspiring UX Designer and full time student based in The Hague, Netherlands. I’m passionate about creating practical and aesthetic experiences for our world. 

              <br>I’ve recently graduated from an American International School in Hong Kong. I have lived in Hong Kong for my whole life and am currently a first year user experience design student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. </br>

              <br>For past experiences, I worked as a personal assistant for a startup brand, providing my assistance to both administrative and marketing duties. It was during my time at school and my job that I learnt how important stories are to people. A story and purpose behind a design is what grasp a user’s attention. With that, it started my interest in UX/UI Design.</br>

              <br>In my down time, you’ll either find me in yoga studio, thinking about travelling, or with a cup of coffee in my hand. </br>
