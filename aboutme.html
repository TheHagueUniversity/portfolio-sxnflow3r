              <p>Hey! I’m Jamie, an aspiring UX Designer and full time student based in The Hague, Netherlands. I am originally half Scottish and half Hong Kong.  I’m passionate about creating practical and aesthetic experiences for our world. My main goal that I aspire to in my career is to create meaningful stories and purpose behind designs that I produce which grasps my clients attention to ideas they never thought could be plausable. 


              <br>I’ve recently graduated from an American International School in Hong Kong. I have lived in Hong Kong for my whole life and am currently a first year user experience design student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. </br>

              <br>For past experiences, I worked as a personal assistant for a startup brand, providing my assistance to both administrative and marketing duties. I also was previously the president of the American International School's prom committee.</br>

              <br>In my down time, you’ll either find me in yoga studio, thinking about travelling, or with a cup of coffee in my hand! </br>
