              <h2>FUNDRAISING</h2>
              <p>Most of the first half of the year was fundraising for the main event. I had to organise, create proposals for administrative approval, and execute the fundraising event. One of my major accomplishments of the fundraising events was being given permission to be the first group of seniors who are allowed to wear their senior hoodies during school hours. Previously, this was not allowed. The hoodies were used to raise money for prom. I was really satisfied with this as I worked really hard to both design the hoodie, get the hoodies approved by administration, as well as work with manufacturers to produce the hoodies in under a month. Here are some of the hoodie drafts that we made before the final design. </p>

             <h2>PROM NIGHT</h2>
             <p>The month leading up the prom was one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do.I had to organise the hotel's demands and requests, students, teachers, the photobooths, and also the decoration manufacturers. It was very difficult to manage and it was all left to me. Overall, it turned out successfully. Here are some images of the night.</p>
